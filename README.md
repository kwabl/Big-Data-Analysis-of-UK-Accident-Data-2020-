## **Big-Data-Analysis-of-UK-Accident-Data-2020**

This code analyses 2020 UK accident data from the Department of Transport to explore the trends associated
with the factors involved in road traffic accidents. The analysis includes performing association
mining using the Apriori algorithm. Clustering analysis (using the KMeans algorithm) will also be
carried out on specific regions in Humberside to determine patterns associated with accidents in
each region. Finally, a predictive model will be developed using Random Forest to predict fatal
injuries sustained in road traffic accidents.
